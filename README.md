# FreelanceFlow 💵

Welcome to the **Freelancers' Income and Tax Management Platform**—a full-stack solution designed to simplify financial chaos for freelancers. Track income, manage invoices, and tackle taxes with ease—all in one place. Built during a 16-hour hackathon, this project is still in active development, with frontend and backend components ready but facing some integration hurdles. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## 🚀 Project Overview

Freelancers juggle multiple challenges—unorganized finances, tricky invoicing, and complex tax calculations. Our platform streamlines these tasks with an intuitive dashboard, automated tools, and smart insights. While we’ve built a functional MVP, we’re currently ironing out full frontend-backend connectivity.

### Key Features
- **Income & Expense Tracking**: Log and manage your earnings and spending effortlessly.
- **Invoice Generation**: Create and download professional invoices as PDFs.
- **Tax Calculation**: Get basic tax estimates tailored to your income (more optimization coming soon!).
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with Firebase/JWT.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Work globally with ease (in progress).
